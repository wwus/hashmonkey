# Large Examples

These examples were too large for regular GitHub markdown viewing. As such I've
made pages in this folder that will redirect to the appropriate long URLs.

In general, redirecting to long URLs with HTML pages is hilariously pointless,
but here it makes sense to demonstrate what URLs cloned with the bookmarklet
can be like, as well as what some larger examples are like.
